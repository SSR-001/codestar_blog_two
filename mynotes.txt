my URL for database:
postgresql://neondb_owner:npg_ugvMQnsO1r5K@ep-late-fire-ag3jyn1a.c-2.eu-central-1.aws.neon.tech/elf_lens_coach_321437
but this is the URL I can go to on a web browser:
https://dbs.ci-dbs.net/manage/H69v86h600AjGkSc/

am I using the right URL in the config vars and env.py? this can be tested later.
